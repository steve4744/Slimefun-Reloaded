# Slimefun Reloaded
Slimefun Reloaded is a plugin which aims to basically turn your Bukkit Server into a modpack like FTB without installing a single mod. It offers everything you could possibly imagine. From Backpacks to Jetpacks!
It also adds an API allowing you guys to easily install/code Addons for this.
You own a Server which is not only minigame based and your players got bored of playing Survival?
Then you will absolutely love this Plugin! 
It adds a whole new layer of survival to your server by adding more than 400+ new Items!
